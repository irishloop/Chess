This is a repository for my JavaScript enabled Chess game by Joshua Levinson (levinson420@yahoo.com).

Will initially be created with JavaScript, jQuery, jQuery UI.  Human players/interface.

Stages of development are:
1. Setup basic board/pieces
2. Work on piece attributes
3. Determine legal maneuvers
4. Setup capturing/scoring
5. Setup end game conditions
6. Work on Computer AI

Current progress:
1. Game board is represented, both in model and UI
2. Moves are generally legal
3. Checkmate can be achieved
4. Castling/Pawn Promotion have now been implemented
5. Outlier moves still to be performed
